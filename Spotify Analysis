#For this Analysis Project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
#I created a table to store the Spotify data.
# Lastly,I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Lastly, I performed Data Exploration using SQL in the following queries

#Which Artist has the record with the most danceability?
SELECT artist_name, danceability,track_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE danceability =
(SELECT MAX(danceability) FROM Spotifydata);

#What is the name of the record with the least popularity ( include it's popularity) ?
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM SpotifyData
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 1;

#List all the tracks made by the Artist 'BTS'
SELECT track_name, artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name='BTS';

#Who is the most popular artist?
SELECT Artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1;

#What is the average popularity of each artist's tracks on Spotify?
SELECT artist_name, (AVG(popularity)) AS AveragePopularity
FROM SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AveragePopularity DESC;

# Which tracks have a duration of more than 3 minutes but no more than 3.5 minutes?
SELECT track_name,duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms >180000
AND duration_ms <=210000
ORDER BY duration_ms ASC;

# Find out how many tracks each artist has Then, order from least to greatest.
SELECT artist_name,(COUNT(track_name)) AS TotalTracks
FROM SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY TotalTracks ASC;
